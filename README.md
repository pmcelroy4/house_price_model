# 🏡 House Price Prediction Model

This project uses a supervised machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features such as square footage, location, number of bedrooms, and more.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a regression model that can accurately estimate housing prices using a dataset of residential properties. The pipeline includes:

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Prediction on unseen data
- Visualizations for interpretation
